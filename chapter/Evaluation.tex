\chapter{Evaluation}
This chapter presents the evaluation results of the different design iterations from the SUS, usability testing and Nielsen`s heuristics.

\section{Participants}
Different groups evaluated each design iteration and the project switched between usability experts and intended users. The first group that participated in a focus group consisted of intended users who were a group of friends with a similar fitness level and were all motivated to improving their fitness levels. The other groups were usability experts who have all gotten a IT related degree and have participated in courses with interaction design and human-computer interaction.

\section{System Usability Scale}
The usability experts evaluated the application first with a system usability scale (SUS) method. The experts evaluated the prototype on a laptop screen with an iPhone X layout. The intented users evaluated the prototype on a ..

\section{SUS with Experts}
The usability experts did the SUS evaluation during the third design iteration with a mid-fidelity prototype with some functionality implemented. The usability experts returned an average score of 92. The experts answered the survey individually and were in the same room.
\section{SUS with Users}\label{susu}

\section{Usability Testing}\label{usat}
Two users were prestented with three different tasks and were timed to find out how effective and efficiently they could use the prototype. The users were not given any instructions on how to solve a task, however they had prior knowledge about the prototype as they evaluated it with SUS. 
Noticeable differences in users?

Task 1 was to find a prior workout??

Task 2, change goals??

Task 3, find friends workout??

\section{Heuristics with experts}\label{heur}
Nielsen`s heuristics was used as the last step of the fourth design iteration. Two/Three information science masters students evaluated and tested the high-fidelity prototype. The evaluators were prestend the prototype on a laptop with iPhone X layout and evaluated the prototype seperately. Below is the condensed feedback for all of the ten heuristics.

\textbf{1. Visibility of System Status:}

\textbf{2. Match between the System and the Real World}

\textbf{3. User control and Freedom}

\textbf{4. Consistency and Standard}

\textbf{5. Error provention}

\textbf{6. Recognition rather than Recall}

\textbf{7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use}

\textbf{8. Aesthetics and Minimalistic Design}

\textbf{9. Help Users Recognise, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors}

\textbf{10. Help and Documentation}
