\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter there is a discussion about the methodologies and the methods that were used, the development, design and limitations. The research questions are also discussed and answered at the end. 
\section{Methodologies}

\section{Design Science Research}
The design science research method was used throughout this research project. For the development of the application...
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the research question(design requirements)? 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the artifact? How is the artifact represented?
\end{itemize}
test test 
\begin{itemize}
    \item How are the artifact and the design processes grounded by the knowledge base? What,if any theories support the artifact design and the design process?
\end{itemize}
test test 
\begin{itemize}
    \item What evaluations are performed during the internal design cycles? What design improvements are identified during each cycle?
\end{itemize}
test test 
\begin{itemize}
    \item How is the artifact introduced into the application environment and how is the field tested? What metrics are used to demostrate artifact utility and improvement over previous artifact?
\end{itemize}
test test 
\begin{itemize}
    \item What new knowledge is added to the knowledge base and in what form(e.g peer reviewed literature, meta-artifacts , new theory, new method.) ?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Has the research questions been satisfactorily addressed?

\section{Design Principles}
The design principles were used to improve and focus on the usability of the application. Design principles focuses on design over functionality to achieve an intuitive user interface. The principles are used to enhance the design and are crucial in having continuous development with an easy to use design.

\section{Data Gathering}

\subsection{Literature review}
A literature review was conducted in the first design iteration to gather data. The literature review laid the foundation for the research project and helped in understanding what theoretical and practical work that have previously been done. The literature review showed that technology and social functionality can help people improve their fitness, but that the current research is limited and more research can be done to get more specific information about what users prefer.
