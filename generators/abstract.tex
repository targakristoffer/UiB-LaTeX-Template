The world health organization (WHO) lists insufficient activity as one of the leading risk factors for death worldwide. Insufficient activity can lead to many fatal cardiovascular diseases, obesity, cancer and diabetes.
The world health organization recommends that adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.  Physical activities like running, cycling, playing sports, organized exercise can decrease the health and disease risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle. 


 In this research proposal, a literature review has been done for a social cooperative fitness application that logs training data for friends, families or work place colleagues that have similar fitness goals in mind. The goal of the application is to encourage exercise and keep each member accountable of each other to promote physical health.

 The literature research suggests that having small groups consisting of friends with similar fitness goals are more motivated to exercise and the users keep each other accountable. Using leaderboards in smaller groups is also more beneficial for motivation and can lead to knowledge and information sharing between the users.
 
This research will help the field of human computer interaction to understand how users interact in a social setting while staying motivated by using technology to log their physical activities and exercise.
